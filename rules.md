##### General

**GDG DevFest Omsk 2014 will take place on December 14th in the format of the hackathon!**

Themes of this year's event:

* Wearable Devices
* Future of Web Front-end
* Augmented & Virtual Reality

To take part you should perform the following steps:

1. Come up with original idea
2. Gather your team
3. Apply for the event
4. Get approval from the organizers

##### Idea
It is **required** to use at least one of *thematic* technologies in the list below:

* [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/){:target="_blank"}, [Web Componets](http://webcomponents.org/){:target="_blank"}, [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/){:target="_blank"}, [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/){:target="_blank"}, [BEM](http://bem.info/){:target="_blank"}
* [Android Wear SDK](https://developer.android.com/wear/index.html){:target="_blank"}, [Pebble SDK](http://developer.getpebble.com/){:target="_blank"}, [Apple WatchKit SDK](https://developer.apple.com/watchkit/){:target="_blank"}, [Tizen SDK for Wearable](http://developer.samsung.com/gear){:target="_blank"}
* [Glass Mirror API](https://developers.google.com/glass/){:target="_blank"}, [Glass Development Kit](https://developers.google.com/glass/develop/gdk/){:target="_blank"}
* [Cardboard VR SDK](https://developers.google.com/cardboard/overview){:target="_blank"}, [Oculus Rift SDK](https://developer.oculus.com/){:target="_blank"}

The secret of successful idea is that it's simple and interesting for you to make. We do not encourage you to impress others with complexity of the project, yet well-built realization of simple idea is the key to win. Notice, you can create new app on the hackathon or improve already existing one.

##### Team
**Required** team size is 2-3 participants. Team members and idea must be determined by the time of application! Well-built team and role playing are vital for successful programming on hackathons, so you are strongly recommended to discuss your idea and roles before the event. If you don't have a team right now, feel free to find your one through collaboration in [handy Google Doc](http://goo.gl/nrpo5B){:target="_blank"}.

##### Application
Use [TimePad service](http://gdg-omsk.timepad.ru/event/160828/){:target="_blank"} to apply for the event. It is **required** to select number of tickets equal to number of members of your team. Be careful while filling in the application form. Once you finish, organizers will consider your team to be event participants.

##### Approval
In case your idea corresponds to the regulations above, sounds realistic and is practically perspective, you are likely to get approved in a couple days from application day. Approval is sent in a form of a special e-mail, containing digital tickets. These tickets will be your entry key for the event.

In the other case you will get a letter of disapproval. If your application was disapproved, feel free to apply again with a different idea.

##### Seminar (Bonus!)
On December 13th we will organize educational and discussional seminar. Every ticket holder are invited to a visit the seminar! Experts and community members will speak about development for Android Wear, usage of Polymer and Web Components for bulding web-apps, programming of virtual and augmented reality with Google Cardbard, and also about basics of Material design for developers and designers. A schedule of the seminar as well as infomation about speakers are available here — http://www.gdg-devfest-omsk.org/schedule.

##### Hackathon
Hackathon will have three parts. In the beginning each team will make short Elevator Pitch about project idea and plans for hackathon. Next, all teams will have 8 hours to hack their projects with breaks for rest and pizzas. At the end, we will have HackFair, where each team will be able to show their results to judges and other participants.

##### Conditions for work
Every team will be provided with comforts needed to work within the project: experts to talk to, high speed internet and sockets to charge the devices. In the middle of the day a tasty lunch will be served; tea,coffee and snacks are available at any time.
   
Please, note that every team is responsible for supplying itself with necessary equipment like laptops, wearable computing, smart phones, usb-cables, etc.

##### Judging
Winners in three main categories (Wearable Devices, Modern Web Front-end, Augmented & Virtual Reality) will be based on results of the hackfair and quilified juries' verdict. 

Winners in main *Grand Prix* nomination will be based on results of the hackfair and quilified juries' verdict. 

Also an unlimited number of wins prizes can be in following categories:

1. *I'm Ready* — prizes for all teams, which:
   * Published / deployed a project
   * Took part in the hackfair
   * Shared results and feedback about DevFest

2. *I love Open Source* — prizes for all teams, which:
   * Published sources to GitHub

3. *I'm feeling lucky* — prizes for lucky persons

##### Prizes
We have a number of really cool prizes for good projects! However, it is well-known that true Siberians go on hackathons to keep themselves on the edge of their seats, overwhelmed by unique atmosphere and drive, disparate experience and top-level projects, all combined with new professional contacts! So we will keep it a secret what the prizes are this year ;-)
